HOW IT WORKS

Four phases to transform your idea into production-ready code.

Phase 1: Discovery
Socrates asks thoughtful questions about your project. What problem are you solving? Who are your users? What's your timeline?

Phase 2: Analysis
Deep dive into requirements, constraints, and technical decisions. What are specific requirements? What tech do you prefer?

Phase 3: Design
Architecture and system design decisions. How should it be architected? What's your data model? How do components interact?

Phase 4: Implementation
Generate production-ready code from your specification. Select language. Generate code in 10-30 seconds.
