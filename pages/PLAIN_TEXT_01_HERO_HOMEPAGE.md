HOW IT WORKS

Socrates guides you through 4 phases to transform your idea into production-ready code.

Phase 1: Discovery
Socrates asks thoughtful questions to understand your project.
What problem are you solving? Who are your users? What's your timeline?
Result: Clear project goals documented

Phase 2: Analysis
Deep dive into requirements, constraints, and technical decisions.
What are specific requirements? What tech do you prefer? What risks exist?
Result: Comprehensive specification

Phase 3: Design
Architecture and system design decisions.
How should it be architected? What's your data model? How do components interact?
Result: Complete technical design

Phase 4: Implementation
Generate production-ready code from your specification.
Review specification, select language, generate code
Result: Production-ready code ready to deploy

Total Time: 1-3 hours from idea to working code

WHY SOCRATES

For Individual Developers:
Save weeks on planning and architecture. Generate code scaffolding instantly. Focus on business logic, not boilerplate.

For Teams:
Everyone understands requirements because you built them together. Better code quality from clear specifications. Team alignment from day one. Reduce rework and refactoring.

For Project Managers:
Clear specifications before development starts. Accurate estimates based on defined scope. Better team coordination. Track progress against specifications. Reduce scope creep.
