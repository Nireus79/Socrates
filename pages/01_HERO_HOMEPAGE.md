## How It Works - Quick Summary

### The Socratic Method Meets Code Generation

Socrates guides you through **4 phases** of structured thinking:

**1. Discovery** 🔍
- Who are your users?
- What problem are you solving?
- What's the project goal?

**2. Analysis** 📋
- What are the specific requirements?
- What constraints do you have?
- What technology matters?

**3. Design** 🏗️
- How will the system work?
- What's the architecture?
- What are the key decisions?

**4. Implementation** 💻
- Generate production-ready code
- Get documented specifications
- Export to your favorite tools
