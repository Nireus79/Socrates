- Minimize initial investment

Example: "Build MVP in a weekend"

LIMITATIONS - When NOT to Use Socrates

1. Embedded Systems

Why not: Socrates generates high-level code, not bare-metal firmware

Don't use for:
- IoT firmware
- Microcontroller programming
- RTOS development
- Hardware abstraction layers

Use instead: ARM Mbed, PlatformIO, MPLAB

2. Real-Time Systems

Why not: Generated code doesn't optimize for microsecond-level timing

Don't use for:
- Audio processing (needs low latency)
- Game engines (real-time rendering)
- Trading systems (millisecond precision)
- Robotics control loops

Use instead: Hand-optimized C/C++, Rust

3. Machine Learning and AI

Why not: Requires specialized knowledge, not generic scaffolding

Don't use for:
- Model training pipelines
- Neural network architecture
- Data preprocessing complex logic
- Statistical analysis

Use instead: TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn
Coming: v1.5 - ML scaffolding support

4. System-Level Programming

Why not: Needs low-level optimization and unsafe code

Don't use for:
- Operating system kernels
- Drivers
- Performance-critical systems
- Memory management
- Concurrency primitives

Use instead: Hand-written C/Rust

5. Very Complex Business Logic

Why not: Socrates generates structure, you add business logic

Don't use for:
- Complex financial calculations
- Advanced statistical analysis
- Specialized domain algorithms
- Business rule engines (>1000 rules)

Use instead: Expert-written domain code

6. Legacy System Integration

Why not: Requires understanding of existing codebase

Don't use for:
- Refactoring old code
- Integrating with legacy systems
- Modernizing monoliths
- Migration from old frameworks

Use instead: Domain experts familiar with legacy system

7. Highly Specialized Domains

Why not: Requires deep domain expertise

Don't use for:
- Genomics analysis
- Quantum computing
- Scientific computing
- Specialized medical software
- Aerospace/aviation systems

Use instead: Domain-specific experts and tools

8. Security-Critical Systems

Why not: Needs thorough security review (not auto-generated)

Don't use as-is for:
- Banking/payment systems
- Healthcare systems (PHI/HIPAA)
- Government systems
- Military applications
- Cryptographic algorithms

Use for: Initial scaffold, then have security experts review

PROJECT COMPLEXITY GUIDE

Sweet Spot for Socrates:

Project Scope: 100-5000 lines of code
- Too small: "Hello world" examples
- Too large: > 50,000 lines (use Socrates per module)

Complexity: Medium
- Moderate number of features (5-20)
- Clear architecture
- Well-defined requirements
- Standard patterns

Development Time: Days to Weeks
- Too quick: Already know exactly what to build
- Too slow: Requirements are vague/changing rapidly

Team Size: 1-10 people
- Solo developers: Perfect
- Small teams: Good (use Pro tier)
- Large teams: Possible (use Enterprise)
