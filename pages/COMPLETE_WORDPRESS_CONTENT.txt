HOW IT WORKS

Four phases transform your idea into production-ready code.

Phase 1: Discovery
Socrates asks thoughtful questions. What problem are you solving? Who are your users? What's your timeline?

Phase 2: Analysis
Deep dive into requirements and technical decisions. What are specific requirements? What tech do you prefer?

Phase 3: Design
Architecture and system design. How should it be architected? What's your data model? How do components interact?

Phase 4: Implementation
Generate production-ready code. Select language, generate code in 10-30 seconds.

WHY SOCRATES

For Developers: Save weeks on planning. Generate code scaffolding instantly. Focus on business logic.

For Teams: Everyone understands requirements. Better code quality. Team alignment from day one.

For Project Managers: Clear specifications. Accurate estimates. Better coordination. Reduce scope creep.
