SOCRATES AI - Collaborative Development Platform

Socrates AI is an open-source collaborative development platform that uses AI-guided Socratic questioning to help teams think through complex design and development problems.

Version: 1.1.0
Status: Production Ready
License: MIT (Open Source)

WHAT IS SOCRATES AI

Socrates combines guided AI conversation with a multi-agent system to support collaborative software development. The platform helps teams and individuals clarify project requirements, analyze code, and organize their development workflow.

REAL FEATURES

Socratic Learning: AI-guided questioning for exploring design and development problems. The system asks thoughtful questions to help you think through requirements and architecture.

Multi-Agent System: Specialized agents handle different tasks including project management, code analysis, knowledge synthesis, and conflict detection.

Knowledge Management: Build searchable knowledge bases using vector embeddings (RAG). Import documentation, store architectural decisions, and retrieve relevant information during development.

Real-Time Collaboration: Multiple team members can work together on projects simultaneously with WebSocket-powered real-time updates.

Enterprise Security: JWT authentication with TOTP MFA, OWASP Top 10 protection, role-based access control, rate limiting, and encrypted database fields.

Production Monitoring: Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, health checks, and structured logging for operational visibility.

Kubernetes-Ready: Complete Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, Docker multi-platform builds, and CI/CD automation.

GitHub Integration: Import repositories, analyze code, run tests, and manage projects directly from GitHub.

CODE AND DATA STORAGE

Socrates uses PostgreSQL for primary data storage, Redis for caching and sessions, and ChromaDB for vector-based knowledge management.

PREREQUISITES

Step 1: Python Installation

Check your Python version:
python --version
or
python3 --version

If not installed:

Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev

macOS:
brew install python@3.11

Windows:
Download from https://www.python.org/downloads/
Run installer and check "Add Python to PATH"
Verify: python --version

Step 2: Get Anthropic API Key

Required for using Claude AI with Socrates.

1. Visit https://console.anthropic.com
2. Sign up or log in with your account
3. Navigate to API Keys section
4. Click Create Key
5. Copy the key (starts with sk-ant-)
6. Keep this secret - never commit to version control

Step 3: Node.js and npm (Optional, for Web Frontend)

Required if you want to use web interface with --full flag.

Check if installed:
node --version
npm --version

Ubuntu/Debian:
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs

macOS:
brew install node

Windows:
Download from https://nodejs.org/ (LTS version)
Run installer with defaults
Verify: node --version and npm --version

Step 4: Git Installation (Recommended)

Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt install git

macOS:
brew install git

Windows:
Download from https://git-scm.com/download/win
Run installer with defaults

INSTALLATION STEPS

Step 1: Get the Code

Option A: Clone with Git (recommended)
git clone https://github.com/Nireus79/Socrates.git
cd Socrates

Option B: Download ZIP
1. Visit https://github.com/Nireus79/Socrates
2. Click Code button
3. Click Download ZIP
4. Extract to desired location
5. Open terminal in extracted folder

Step 2: Create Virtual Environment

Virtual environment isolates project dependencies from system Python.

Linux/macOS:
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

Windows (Command Prompt):
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate

Windows (PowerShell):
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

Verify activation: You should see (.venv) prefix in terminal

Step 3: Install Dependencies

Upgrade pip first:
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

Install project dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

This installs:
- anthropic (Claude API client)
- chromadb (vector database)
- sentence-transformers (embedding model)
- PyPDF2 (PDF processing)
- colorama (terminal colors)
- python-dateutil (date utilities)
- And all their dependencies

Installation time: 3-10 minutes depending on internet speed

Step 4: Configure API Key

Option A: Environment Variable (recommended)

Linux/macOS:
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-your-actual-key-here"

To make permanent, add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc:
echo 'export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-your-key"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

Windows (Command Prompt):
setx ANTHROPIC_API_KEY sk-ant-your-actual-key-here

Restart terminal for changes to take effect

Windows (PowerShell):
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY", "sk-ant-your-actual-key-here", "User")

Restart PowerShell

Option B: .env File (for development)

Create .env file in project root:
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-actual-key-here
SOCRATES_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
SOCRATES_DATA_DIR=~/.socrates

Load before running:
export $(cat .env | xargs)
python socrates.py

Option C: Interactive Prompt (fallback)

If not configured, Socrates will prompt for API key on startup.

Step 5: Configure Data Directory (Optional)

By default Socrates stores data in ~/.socrates

To use custom location:

Linux/macOS:
export SOCRATES_DATA_DIR="/custom/path/to/socrates"

Windows:
setx SOCRATES_DATA_DIR "C:\custom\path\to\socrates"

Or in .env:
SOCRATES_DATA_DIR=/custom/path

VERIFICATION

Test your installation:

Run Socrates:
python socrates.py

Expected output:
- Welcome message
- Project listing
- Ready for commands

Test API connection:
The system will test connection to Claude API on startup.

TROUBLESHOOTING

Python not found:
Ensure Python is installed and in PATH
Verify: python --version
Use full path if needed: /usr/bin/python3

Module not found errors:
Ensure virtual environment is activated
Reinstall dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Clear cache: pip cache purge

API key errors:
Verify key at https://console.anthropic.com
Check for spaces before/after key
Key must start with sk-ant-

Permission denied (Linux/macOS):
Ensure proper permissions: chmod +x socrates.py
Or run with python: python socrates.py

Sample Dialogue:
Socrates: What problem are you trying to solve?
You: We need to improve API performance.

Socrates: Which parts of the API are slowest?
You: The database queries take too long.

Socrates: What databases are you using?
You: PostgreSQL with Django ORM.

Continue the conversation to build comprehensive understanding of your project and challenges.

EXPORTING YOUR WORK

Save results in multiple formats:

Export project:
/project export
