PAGE 10: WHAT MAKES SOCRATES DIFFERENT
====================================================================

WHAT MAKES SOCRATES DIFFERENT

Why Choose Socrates AI Over Alternatives

THE SOCRATIC METHOD APPROACH

Not Just Code Generation:
Most tools generate code. Socrates guides you through thinking.

Socrates Uses:
- Socratic questioning to explore problems
- Guided dialogue to clarify requirements
- Structured phases to organize work
- Knowledge synthesis to maintain understanding

This Means:
- You think more clearly about your project
- Better architecture decisions
- Team alignment on goals
- Documented reasoning
- Stronger foundations

Most Alternatives:
- Generate code without guidance
- No problem exploration
- No structured thinking
- Missing the "why" in decisions

MULTI-AGENT ARCHITECTURE
