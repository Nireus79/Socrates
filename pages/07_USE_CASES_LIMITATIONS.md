- Specialized medical software
- Aerospace/aviation systems

✅ **Use instead**: Domain-specific experts and tools

---

#### 8. Security-Critical Systems
**Why not**: Needs thorough security review (not auto-generated)

❌ **Don't use as-is for**:
- Banking/payment systems
- Healthcare systems (PHI/HIPAA)
- Government systems
- Military applications
- Cryptographic algorithms

✅ **Use for**: Initial scaffold, then have security experts review

---

#### 9. Performance-Critical Code
**Why not**: Generated code prioritizes readability over optimization

❌ **Don't use for**:
- High-frequency trading
- Game rendering
- Video encoding/decoding
- Large-scale data processing
- Search algorithms

✅ **Use for**: Initial implementation, optimize later
