  Analysis:

  We DON'T need more tests right now because:

  1. Existing tests reveal real issues - The failing tests are exposing genuine bugs, not testing gaps
  2. Poor test isolation - Some tests are affecting others (fixtures/mocks bleeding across test runs)
  3. Test infrastructure issues - Regressions suggest test execution order dependencies
  4. Coverage is actually good - We have ~400+ tests across 13+ major test files

  What we ACTUALLY need is:

  1. Fix test isolation problems - Tests passing individually but failing in full suite
  2. Fix remaining implementation bugs - ~100+ test failures indicate real issues
  3. Add test fixtures for edge cases - Better mocking for complex scenarios
  4. Integration test cleanup - E2E tests have environment/state management issues

  Recommendation:

  Before writing NEW tests, we should:

  1. Fix test isolation - Root cause why tests pass individually but fail together
  2. Fix remaining 100+ failures - These reveal real implementation gaps
  3. Add fixtures for missing scenarios - Better coverage of edge cases in existing tests
  4. Improve test organization - Clear test setup/teardown to prevent cross-contamination

  Once fixed, we should add tests for:
  - Subscription tier enforcement edge cases
  - Error recovery and retry logic
  - Concurrent operation handling
  - Database transaction rollback scenarios
  - API rate limiting and timeout handling
