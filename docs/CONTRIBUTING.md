## Development Guidelines

### Architecture Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Database layer (project_db.py)
   - Business logic (sponsorships/, subscription/)
   - API layer (routers/)

2. **Dependency Injection**
   - Use FastAPI dependencies
   - Inject database connections
   - Inject configuration

3. **Error Handling**
   - Use specific HTTP status codes
   - Return meaningful error messages
   - Log errors for debugging

4. **Security**
   - Validate all inputs
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Protect sensitive endpoints

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest socrates_api/tests/ -v

# Run specific test file
pytest socrates_api/tests/test_sponsorships.py -v

# Run with coverage
pytest socrates_api/tests/ --cov=socrates_api

# Run type checking
mypy socrates_api/
```
