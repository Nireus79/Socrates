## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

1. **Read Architecture First**
   - Don't skip 01_ARCHITECTURE.md
   - Understand layers before coding

2. **Implement User Instructions Early**
   - 04_USER_INSTRUCTIONS.md is critical
   - Affects all agent interactions
   - Part of design, not afterthought

3. **Follow Action Flows**
   - Reference 09_ACTION_FLOW_MAP.md
   - Don't guess user journeys
   - Verify each flow works end-to-end

4. **Test Early & Often**
   - Don't wait until end
   - Follow 14_TESTING_STRATEGY.md
   - Integrate tests into workflow

5. **Use Type Hints**
   - Backend: Python type hints everywhere
   - Frontend: TypeScript strict mode
   - Catches bugs early
