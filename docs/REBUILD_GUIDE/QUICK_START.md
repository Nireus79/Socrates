## PROJECT OVERVIEW IN 60 SECONDS

**Socrates v2.0** is a complete rebuild of the existing Socrates system with:

- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python) replacing Flask
- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript replacing Jinja templates
- **Database:** PostgreSQL replacing SQLite
- **New Feature:** User Instructions (users define AI behavior rules)
- **Preserved:** All 9 existing agents work unchanged
- **Stack:** Modern, scalable, production-ready

**Key Innovation:** User Instructions System allows users to set binding constraints on ALL AI operations:
- "Always include tests"
- "Prioritize security"
- "Maintain backward compatibility"
- etc.

## GETTING STARTED

### Step 1: Read the Architecture (10 minutes)
Start with **01_ARCHITECTURE.md** to see:
- System layers (Presentation, API, Service, Repository, Data)
- Data flow examples
- Component relationships
- Design decisions

### Step 2: Set Up Your Project (30 minutes)
Follow **02_PROJECT_SETUP.md**:
```bash
# Backend
mkdir Socrates-Rebuild
cd Socrates-Rebuild
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Frontend
npx create-react-app frontend --template typescript
cd frontend
npm install ...
```

### Step 3: Understand Backend Layers (30 minutes)
Read **03_BACKEND_LAYERS.md**:
- Database models (SQLAlchemy)
- Repository pattern (CRUD operations)
- Service layer (business logic)
- API routers (FastAPI endpoints)

### Step 4: Implement User Instructions (1-2 hours)
This is the **CRITICAL NEW FEATURE** - read **04_USER_INSTRUCTIONS.md**:
- User creates rules like "Always include tests"
- Rules are stored in database
- Enforced on every agent operation
- Audit logged with compliance tracking

### Step 5: Integrate Agents (2-3 hours)
Read **05_AGENT_INTEGRATION.md**:
- Copy existing 9 agents into FastAPI project
- Create AgentOrchestrator
- Implement AgentService wrapper
- Route requests through instruction validation

### Step 6: Build Frontend (4-6 hours)
Follow **06_FRONTEND_STRUCTURE.md** and **08_STATE_MANAGEMENT.md**:
- Create React components
- Set up Redux store
- Implement API service layer
- Build User Instructions panel

## CRITICAL FEATURES - IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE

### 1. User Instructions System ⭐⭐⭐
**Why:** Core differentiator and most important feature
**What:** Users define AI behavior rules
**Where:** See 04_USER_INSTRUCTIONS.md
**Impact:** All agent operations respect these rules

### 2. All 9 Agents Integrated ⭐⭐⭐
**Why:** Preserves all existing business logic
**What:** Orchestrate existing agents through FastAPI
**Where:** See 05_AGENT_INTEGRATION.md
**Impact:** Full functionality from day 1

### 3. QualityAnalyzer Validation ⭐⭐
**Why:** Ensures quality of all outputs
**What:** Score and validate every AI result
**Where:** See 12_QUALITY_ASSURANCE.md
**Impact:** Confidence in results

### 4. Authentication ⭐⭐
**Why:** Security and multi-user support
**What:** JWT-based auth with refresh tokens
**Where:** See 03_BACKEND_LAYERS.md + 10_API_INTEGRATION.md
**Impact:** Secure multi-tenant system

### 5. Real-Time WebSocket ⭐
**Why:** Better user experience
**What:** Live message updates during sessions
**Where:** See 11_REAL_TIME_FEATURES.md
**Impact:** Professional feel

## COMMON QUESTIONS

### Q: Do I need to rewrite the agents?
**A:** No! All 9 existing agents are preserved as-is. Just copy them into the new project structure.

### Q: How do user instructions work?
**A:** Users enter plain English rules (e.g., "Always include tests"). The system parses these, stores them, and enforces them on every agent operation. If an operation violates a rule, it's rejected.

### Q: Can I skip the frontend for now?
**A:** Yes, but you'll be missing User Instructions panel. For internal testing, you can use curl or Postman with the API endpoints.

### Q: How long will this take?
**A:** 40-60 hours total (5-8 working days). See IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md for detailed phase breakdown.

### Q: What's the hardest part?
**A:** Getting User Instructions enforcement right - it needs to work on every agent path. See 04_USER_INSTRUCTIONS.md and 05_AGENT_INTEGRATION.md for details.

### Q: Can I deploy incrementally?
**A:** Absolutely! After each phase (backend core, then frontend, then WebSocket, etc.), you can deploy to staging and test.
