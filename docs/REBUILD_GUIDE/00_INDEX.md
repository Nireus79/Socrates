# SOCRATES COMPLETE REBUILD GUIDE
## Total Integration of Current Agent System with Modern Stack

**Version:** 2.0 (Integrating Existing Agent Architecture)
**Status:** Ready for Implementation
**Estimated Duration:** 40-60 hours of focused development
**Tech Stack:** FastAPI (Backend) + React + TypeScript (Frontend) + PostgreSQL + ChromaDB

---

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: User Instructions Area

**NEW FEATURE:** Embedded instructions panel for users to define AI behavior rules.

This allows users to set fundamental constraints and guidelines that ALL agents must follow:

```
EXAMPLE USER INSTRUCTIONS:
- "Always ask for clarification before making architectural decisions"
- "Prioritize security over performance"
- "Require approval for breaking changes"
- "Maintain backward compatibility"
- "Use TypeScript for all frontend code"
- "Document all decisions with rationale"
```

These instructions are:
- ✓ Stored in database per user/project
- ✓ Retrieved and passed to QualityAnalyzer
- ✓ Enforced through validation decorator
- ✓ Logged in audit trail
- ✓ Overridable only with explicit confirmation

## KEY CHANGES FROM CURRENT SYSTEM

### What Works (Keep It)
- ✅ 9 core agents (all business logic preserved)
- ✅ QualityAnalyzer (all validation logic preserved)
- ✅ CodeEditor (all code modification capabilities preserved)
- ✅ Agent orchestrator pattern
- ✅ Service container pattern
- ✅ Database models and repositories

### What Needs Replacing
- ❌ Flask web app → FastAPI REST API
- ❌ Jinja2 templates → React components
- ❌ SQLite → PostgreSQL
- ❌ jQuery/Bootstrap → React + TypeScript + Tailwind

## QUICK START TIMELINE

**Week 1 (40 hours):**
- Phase 0: Project setup (6 hours)
- Phase 1: Backend core (15 hours)
- Phase 2: Frontend setup (12 hours)
- Phase 3: Basic API integration (7 hours)

## CRITICAL POINTS

1. **User Instructions are NOT Optional**
   - Must be implemented from day 1
   - Part of every agent validation
   - Central to constraint system

2. **Preserve Existing Agents**
   - All 9 agents work as-is
   - No refactoring needed
   - Just need adapter layer

3. **QualityAnalyzer is Mandatory**
   - Every action validated
   - User instructions checked
   - Bias detection enabled

4. **Type Safety**
   - All TypeScript (frontend)
   - Type hints throughout (Python)
   - Strict mode enabled

5. **Testing from Day 1**
   - Unit tests for each layer
   - Integration tests for workflows
   - E2E tests for critical paths

---

## HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE

1. **Start with 01_ARCHITECTURE.md** - Understand the full system design
2. **Read 02_PROJECT_SETUP.md** - Set up your development environment
3. **Follow phases in order** - Each builds on previous
4. **Refer to action flow map** (09_ACTION_FLOW_MAP.md) - When confused about flow
5. **Check troubleshooting** (16_TROUBLESHOOTING.md) - When stuck

---

## WHAT YOU'LL HAVE AT THE END

A complete, production-ready Socrates system with:

- ✅ Full React TypeScript frontend with modern UI
- ✅ FastAPI backend with type-safe endpoints
- ✅ All 9 agents fully integrated
- ✅ User instructions system working
- ✅ QualityAnalyzer validating every action
- ✅ Code editing capabilities available
- ✅ Real-time updates via WebSocket
- ✅ Complete test coverage
- ✅ Docker-ready deployment
- ✅ Production-grade performance

**Estimated Lines of Code:**
- Backend: 3,000-4,000 lines (FastAPI + agents)
- Frontend: 4,000-5,000 lines (React + TypeScript)
- Tests: 2,000-3,000 lines
- Total: 9,000-12,000 lines
