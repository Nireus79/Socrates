## CRITICAL DECISIONS DOCUMENTED

### 1. User Instructions as Core Feature
Not a nice-to-have, but a fundamental constraint system:
- Users define binding rules
- Enforced on all agent operations
- Violations logged and blocked
- Audit trail maintained
- See: 04_USER_INSTRUCTIONS.md

### 2. Preservation of 9 Agents
No rewrites needed - integration layer handles adaptation:
- Copy agents as-is
- Create AgentService wrapper
- Apply user instructions at routing layer
- Validate output through QualityAnalyzer
- See: 05_AGENT_INTEGRATION.md

### 3. Service Layer Pattern
Separation of concerns through layered architecture:
- Repository: Database operations
- Service: Business logic & orchestration
- Router: HTTP handling
- Model: Data structure
- See: 03_BACKEND_LAYERS.md

### 4. Redux for State Management
Complete Redux architecture with async thunks:
- Auth state (login, user, token)
- Project state (filtering, pagination)
- Session state (messages, real-time)
- Instructions state (user rules)
- UI state (sidebar, theme, notifications)
- See: 08_STATE_MANAGEMENT.md

### 5. WebSocket for Real-Time
Not HTTP polling, but true real-time updates:
- Connection manager
- Message broadcasting
- Auto-reconnection logic
- Background agent processing
- Typing indicators
- See: 11_REAL_TIME_FEATURES.md

---

## UNIQUE ASPECTS

**First system to implement this feature**
- Allows users to define AI constraints
- Example: "Always include tests"
- Enforced on all operations
- Audit logged

### 2. Complete Architecture Documentation
**Not just code, but understanding**
- Why each decision was made
- How components interact
- Data flow through system
- Error handling strategy
- Scalability considerations

### 3. Production-Ready Specifications
**Not just examples, but production specs**
- Complete API specifications
- Error handling for all cases
- Rate limiting strategy
- Security considerations
- Performance optimization

### 4. Clear Implementation Path
**Phases are sequential and build on each other**
- Each phase adds clear value
- Can deploy after each phase
- Tests integrated throughout
- Metrics tracked from day 1
