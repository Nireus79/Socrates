## 🧠 The Socratic Process

### What is Socratic Questioning?

The Socratic method uses targeted questions to help you:
- **Clarify your thinking** about project requirements
- **Identify hidden assumptions** and potential issues
- **Explore different perspectives** through role-based questioning
- **Develop comprehensive specifications** for code generation

### The Question Flow

1. **Initial Project Concept**
   - System asks about your basic idea
   - Helps define scope and objectives

2. **Role-Based Deep Dive**
   - Questions from 7 different professional perspectives
   - Each role focuses on their area of expertise

3. **Conflict Resolution**
   - System identifies contradictions or gaps
   - Facilitates resolution through targeted questions

4. **Specification Refinement**
   - Final validation of requirements
   - Preparation for code generation

### Question Types

**Open-Ended Questions**: "How do you envision users interacting with this feature?"

**Clarifying Questions**: "When you say 'real-time,' do you mean updates within seconds or minutes?"

**Assumption-Challenging Questions**: "What if this integration service is unavailable?"

**Perspective Questions**: "How would a new user experience this differently than an expert?"
