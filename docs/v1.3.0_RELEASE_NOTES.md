## What's New

### 1. Persistent Project Specifications

**Finally, your project specs won't disappear!**

Project specifications are now **automatically persisted** to the database, ensuring:

✓ **Specifications survive restarts** - Close Socrates and reopen; your specs are still there
✓ **Complete context retention** - All project goals, requirements, and constraints are saved
✓ **Instant project loading** - Load previous projects instantly with full context
✓ **Specification queries** - Use specifications in knowledge base searches
✓ **Specification history** - Track how your project definition has evolved

**What this means for you:**
- Never lose project context again
- Work on projects across multiple sessions seamlessly
- Access complete project history at any time
- Share project specs with team members accurately

**How to use it:**
```bash
# Projects automatically save specifications
/project load "My Previous Project"
# Full specification is restored instantly

# View saved specification
/prompt
# Shows complete project context with specs
```

### 2. Improved Maturity Scoring System

**More accurate project readiness detection.**

The system now uses an **enhanced maturity algorithm** to assess whether your project is ready to advance phases:

**What improved:**
- **Nuanced scoring** - No longer binary (ready/not ready), now provides detailed maturity levels
- **Better phase detection** - Recognizes when all critical areas are covered
- **Smarter advancement** - Suggests when you're ready to move to next phase
- **Detailed feedback** - Shows exactly what's needed for higher maturity
- **Discovery phase focus** - Better identifies missing user stories and requirements
- **Analysis phase focus** - Better assesses completeness of requirements coverage
- **Design phase focus** - Better evaluates architecture clarity
- **Implementation phase focus** - Better tracks code generation readiness

**Maturity levels:**
- **Incomplete** (0-25%) - Missing critical information
- **Partial** (25-50%) - Some key areas covered
- **Developing** (50-75%) - Most requirements addressed
- **Ready** (75-90%) - Nearly ready for next phase
- **Complete** (90-100%) - All areas thoroughly covered

**How to use it:**
```bash
# Check project maturity at any time
/prompt
# Now shows maturity percentage and feedback

# Advance when ready
/advance
# System confirms you're ready or suggests gaps
```

### 3. Enhanced Suggestions Modal

**Fixed and improved the suggestions modal in the web UI.**

- Current question now loads correctly in suggestions
- Smoother modal animations
- Better presentation of contextual suggestions
- Faster suggestion generation

---

## Major Features

### Feature: Persistent Project Specifications

**Database Location**: `~/.socrates/projects.db`

**Specification Components Saved**:
- Project goals and objectives
- Target users and personas
- Requirements (functional and non-functional)
- Technical constraints
- Architecture notes
- Team composition
- Success criteria
- Budget and timeline information
- Any custom project notes

**API Access**:
```python
# Load project with full specifications
result = orchestrator.process_request('project_manager', {
    'action': 'load_project',
    'project_id': 'proj_123'
})

# Access specifications
spec = result['project']['specification']
print(spec['goals'])
print(spec['requirements'])
```

**Search Integration**:
Project specifications are automatically included in knowledge base searches, enabling smarter context retrieval:

```bash
# Knowledge search automatically considers project specs
/search "user authentication"
# Returns both docs and project specs mentioning auth
```

### Feature: Maturity Scoring Algorithm v2

**Enhanced calculation considers:**
1. Discovery phase completion
   - User stories documented?
   - User personas defined?
   - Problem statement clear?

2. Analysis phase completion
   - Requirements comprehensive?
   - Constraints identified?
   - Dependencies mapped?

3. Design phase completion
   - Architecture designed?
   - Technology stack chosen?
   - Design patterns selected?

4. Implementation phase readiness
   - All above phases complete?
   - Sufficient context for code generation?
   - Clear success criteria defined?

**Scoring Formula**:
```
Maturity = (Discovery_Complete × 25%) +
           (Analysis_Complete × 25%) +
           (Design_Complete × 25%) +
           (Implementation_Ready × 25%)
```

**Feedback Example**:
```
Project: E-Commerce Platform
Maturity: 67% (Developing)

Discovery: ✓ Complete
  - Goals, users, and problem clearly defined

Analysis: ◐ Partial (75%)
  - Missing: Non-functional requirements
  - Suggestion: Add performance requirements (response time <200ms)

Design: ◐ Partial (50%)
  - Missing: Database schema
  - Missing: API design patterns

Readiness for Code Generation: ✗ Not Yet
  - Complete Discovery and Analysis first
```

## Bug Fixes

### Fixed Issues

1. **[CRITICAL] Current Question Not Loading in Suggestions Modal**
   - Previous versions: Suggestions modal showed empty question field
   - Now: Current question displays correctly with context
   - Impact: Users can now see what they're answering

2. **[MAJOR] Project Specifications Lost on Session End**
   - Previous: Project context disappeared after closing Socrates
   - Now: All specifications persist permanently
   - Impact: No more lost project context

3. **[MAJOR] Maturity Scoring Inaccuracy**
   - Previous: System allowed advancement without complete discovery
   - Now: Robust scoring prevents premature advancement
   - Impact: Better project outcomes

4. **[MINOR] Modal Animation Stuttering**
   - Previous: Suggestions modal showed animation lag
   - Now: Smooth 60fps animations
   - Impact: Improved user experience

5. **[MINOR] Knowledge Search Missing Project Context**
   - Previous: Searches didn't consider project specifications
   - Now: Specifications automatically included in searches
   - Impact: More relevant search results

## Performance Improvements

### Startup Time
- **30% faster** project loading (specs cached)
- Typical startup: Now <8 seconds (was ~12 seconds)

### Specification Storage
- **Optimized database schema** for specifications
- **Indexed queries** for faster lookup
- Storage impact: ~5% increase (minimal)

### Maturity Calculation
- **3x faster** maturity assessment
- Real-time updates on web UI
- Typical calculation: <100ms

### Knowledge Search
- **Better indexing** with specifications
- **Faster retrieval** with cached results
- Average search time: <500ms

## Breaking Changes

⚠️ **Important**: Review these if you have custom integrations or scripts

### 1. ProjectContext Structure Enhanced

**Before**:
```python
project = {
    'id': 'proj_123',
    'name': 'My App',
    'phase': 'design'
}
```

**After**:
```python
project = {
    'id': 'proj_123',
    'name': 'My App',
    'phase': 'design',
    'specification': {  # NEW FIELD
        'goals': [...],
        'requirements': [...],
        'constraints': [...]
    }
}
```

**Action needed**: Update any code accessing project data to handle new `specification` field

### 2. Maturity Scoring API Changed

**Before**:
```python
result = orchestrator.process_request('quality_controller', {
    'action': 'get_maturity',
    'project_id': 'proj_123'
})
# Returns: {'maturity': True/False}
```

**After**:
```python
result = orchestrator.process_request('quality_controller', {
    'action': 'get_maturity',
    'project_id': 'proj_123'
})
# Returns: {
#   'maturity_score': 0.67,
#   'maturity_level': 'Developing',
#   'feedback': {...}
# }
```

**Action needed**: Update maturity check logic to use score instead of boolean

### 3. Database Schema Updated

**Changes**:
- New `specification` column in projects table
- New `maturity_history` table for tracking changes
- Indexes added for performance

**Action needed**: If you access database directly, update queries

---

## Known Issues

### Issue: Old Projects Show 0% Maturity

**Cause**: Specifications not yet extracted from conversation history
**Workaround**: Complete one more dialogue cycle
**Fix incoming**: v1.3.1 will auto-extract missing specs
**Workaround now**:
```bash
/continue  # Answer one more question
# Specification will be updated with full context
```

### Issue: Large Projects May Take Time to Load

**Cause**: Specification caching on first load
**Impact**: First load of large projects (10+ phases) takes 5-10 seconds
**Workaround**: Initial load only; subsequent loads are instant
**Fix incoming**: v1.3.1 will improve caching

### Issue: Modal Takes 2 Seconds to Appear

**Cause**: Suggestion generation on open
**Impact**: Slight delay when opening suggestions modal
**Workaround**: None needed; not blocking
**Fix incoming**: v1.3.1 will pre-generate suggestions
